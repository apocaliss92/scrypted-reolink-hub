## Videoclips
The plugin provides a direct connection to reolink videoclips, it's highly suggested to setup them as FTP, since the home hubs just fall when multiple requests for videoclips are made/
- Setup your hub on your personal FTP server (Turn off subfolder generation for a better result)
- Enable the cameras to FTP
- Provide to scrypted access to the same FTP folder
- Enable the Reolink HUB videoclips extension on each camera and set the same folder provided to the HUB FTP's settings
- The plugin will parse all the present videos and move to another folder, generating all the required data. If you have many videos, the firs start could take some time
